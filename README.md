# Free Code Camp: Responsive Web Design Projects
## Project 1: Build a Tribute Page
### By: Matthew King

With LeBron James now joining the Los Angeles Lakers it seemed fitting to do my first FreeCodeCamp Project by creating a tribute page for LeBron James. The ultimate scope of this project is still unclear but ideas will evolve over time. 

Initial commits to the repository are to serve as a rough draft for what may be added in the future. 

Any sources that I use may be added in the future to the README file.
